# Case-Study-2 

## List of Files
- task_two.java $\rightarrow$ only used for simplification method
- task_three.java $\rightarrow$ only used for DTW 
- task_four.java $\rightarrow$ contains centering methods Approach I and II
-  task_five.java $\rightarrow$ contains Lloyds and seeding algorithms
-  Trajectory, Clustering, Point, Edge, File_methods, and Assignment java files are object types that we use throughout our code
-  The folders with trajectory points (simplified and unsimplified) are used in visualizations to see the background data that we plot our computed trajectories on top of
-  The "center" text files are the output of task4 centering methods for Approach I and II, which we use in visualizations
-  The "averages" text files are the output of Lloyd's algorithm which we use to make our visaulization for clustering cost for different values of k
-  Python files contain matplotlib visualizations for task 4 and 5

## Reproducing Experimental Results

- For task 4, change the epsilon value in the main method to see centering cost for both Approach I and Approach II
